# Exponentiation

This repository contains a C# application that demonstrates how to calculate the power of a number using a simple integer exponentiation method.

## Description

The `Exponentiation` application provides a method called `IntegerPower` that takes two integer arguments, `base` and `exponent`, and calculates the base raised to the power of the exponent. This is done without using any built-in Math library methods, showcasing the fundamental programming concept of loops.
